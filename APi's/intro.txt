API's are like G-Maps in Zomato , Swiggy , or weather API's in other apps

APIs are the Applc pgmg interf = is a set of commands , funcs , protocols & objcs

end points are the urls whc ll give qoutes or anything its deisgned fro

jokes API : https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Programming,Dark,Pun?blacklistFlags=nsfw,sexist,explicit&format=txt&contains=%20&amount=4

PATHS in API ? why do yu need ? 
=> apis can have path/branch if like user needs to customze jokes only regrd pgmg by typng '/pgmg' in URL

why parameters in api?
=> cz wen user needs to search results for even more specifc keywords like java under pgmg as the path
then query takes part i.e, parameters


can also use postman to post our reqsts and get a arranged data
