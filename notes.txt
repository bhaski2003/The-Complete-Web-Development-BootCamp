readme added by us in git is Markdown typo indication ; while HTML is MArkup


id's have more prior over classes whileinn styling


p,h,div are like blocking ele's they'll block render of other elems

while span is the inline element.....then y use block elems cz in inline elms we cnt chnge width of text

asssume if we arrange them as position:inline we cant change thier widths but using position:inline-block we can chnage its hieght and width and style according

<img> is both inline and block

a child sits on top of parent


POSITIOING: 

by def its static i,e. wrt code written ex: h1,p,img rendered as per code's order: h1,p,img

relative: Moving wrt its Static 

assume if we moved a div to left lil then its original position remains unoccupied while in absoulte it can be occupied by other elems

cz in ABSOLUTE we'll position itt in wrt to PARENT

Js:

values given by Math.Random() will never reach >1 will lwys be bte 0-0.999999999
and ofc it changes every time you refresh
--can also modify its vals as per our req : So called PsuedoRandom

var num = Math.random();
num = num*6;
num = Math.floor(num);
// if needed 6 inculsve then = num = Math.floor(num) +1

== now this givs us vals within 1-5 and exclusive of 6

Math.floor(num) will scales/rounds down the val to nearest wholenum

Control Flow is nothing but - ifelse stmnts

even though both == and === both checks for equality but wherin in === it'll also tryna match the data-types

to get len of arr arrayname.length

arraynme.includes('bhask') == gives us bool to indicate tht if its present or not 
if present then 'true' else 'false'

FIZZ-BUZZ prblm:

print FIZZ if odd and BUZZ fr even and if both like 6 then FIZZ-BUZZ

arrynme.push(value) will appends the 'val' to end of the arr alwsys
& not random or start

simple maa-

if( (count)%3 === 0 && count % 5 === 0)
{
	print('FIZZBUZZ')
} 
else if(count % 3 === 0)
{
	print("BUZZ")
}
else if(count % 5 === 0)
{
	print("BUZZ")
}
else{
	print(count)
}
