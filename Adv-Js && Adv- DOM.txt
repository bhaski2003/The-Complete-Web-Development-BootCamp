Adv Js && Adv DOM:

the  best practice is to put the scrippt tag of Js at the end cz , if done like qureyselec or smtng li tht and wen brwser searches itt it wont find the ele if script is as Head so oly


    <p>
        the DOM is Doc Obj MOdel Created by Brwser wen we relod the pge
        <br> its an hierachial representation of the elements in code 
        parent then child ....sub child....
    </p>
    <p>
        we can basically modify our inn Console itself via help of DOM been created by the BRweser
        can modify there itslf everythng including styling we'll select the ele at 1t point by document.firstElementChild or stmng li tht and store it like ele and the ele.innerHTML = "bye"
    </p>
    <p>
        can also use qureyselec for this , also objs inside DOM can hve props , methods
        <br> PROPPS : ar the properties tht it can have
        <br> METHODS: are the things it can do
    </p>
    <strong>
        the main diff btw A Func & Methods is tht 
        Methods are like shd be associated wiith a Obj
        Methods can be as click() , appendChild() , setAttribue , getAttr
<br>
<li>
        selecting them as document.getElemntById(" # ") </li>
       <li> document.getElemntByClassName(" .class ") </li>
      <li>  document.querySelector(" # a")  </li>

      <br> if multiple selectors with the same id/cls then only 1st is retrned
    if need all querySelectorAll <hr>

    <li>
        document.querySelector("h1").style.padding = "30px"
    </li>
    <li>
        document.querySelector("h1").style.fontsize = "10rem"
    </li>
    </strong>
    <p>
        asssume in CSS .huge is already styled
        then to bind it to ele in Console via DOM : document.querySelector("h1").classList.add("huge")
    </p>
<p>
    Diff Btw InnerHTML & TextContent is tht InnerHTMl gives us strainght way whole content inside of HTML tag , if looped tags then prints tht tooo 
    <br> but TextContent gives us actually needed contents
    and in innerHTML we can also add some html elems as = "< em>hii</ em>"

</p>

<p>
    setting Attr , but wht is Attr? = is class,href,src,id,type .......
    <br>
    document.querySelector("a").setAttribute("href" , "www.google.com")
